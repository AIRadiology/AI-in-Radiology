**Welcome to IntelliRadiology's "AI in Radiology" Read the Docs!** 

You will be learning about the many fundemental use-cases of
artificial intelligence in Radiology and will also be introduced to some
of the technologies that IntelliRadiology is working on.

**Project #1: Train an AI in Radiology**

Currently, outside of traditional regression models and boolean tagging
data types, many computer vision systems utilize classification type
systems. We are looking into a multi-phased system in which we build a
data model to detect basic abnormalities all the way to making a full
fledged AI for automated X-Ray tagging and even full fledged digital
X-Ray enhancement. In regards to enhancement, we want to see ways we can
merge pattern recognition systems w/ CLAHE.

**About**

AI is a vastly growing field, and given its expected accelerated rate of
development, various forms of radiography will be computationally
accelerated as well. This will include everything from improving image
quality to sensory methods to diagnosis.
