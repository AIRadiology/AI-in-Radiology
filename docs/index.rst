**Project #1: Train an AI in Radiology**

Currently, outside of traditional regression models and boolean tagging
data types, many computer vision systems utilize classification type
systems. We are looking into a multi-phased system in which we build a
data model to detect basic abnormalities all the way to making a full
fledged AI for automated X-Ray tagging and even full fledged digital
X-Ray enhancement. In regards to enhancement, we want to see ways we can
merge pattern recognition systems w/ CLAHE.
